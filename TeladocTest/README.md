Some clarifications and comments for this test project.

Both tasks were completed according to their descriptions. To my mind in any projects there is a space for some improvements, this project is not an exception. I would add here error handling with implementing some UI additions which could inform user about troubles (for example, when user has no internet connection, file is corrupted and its content can't be parsed and other cases). 
Task about parsing text into words can be discussed with its owner in order to combine am/is/are to one field or to remove articles a/the, but it depends on the main goal of this objective.
